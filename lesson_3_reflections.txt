When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you're at a different computer or if someone else is working on the repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Someone else could be working on repository as well so you would need to see those
	changes first.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
instead of another?

	A fork makes a clone/copy of a repository within GitHub. A clone "downloads" a copy
	of a repository to a local computer. A branch is when you divert from the master
	in order to makes changes that you'd rather not be part of the production copy (yet).

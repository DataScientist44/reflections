When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you're at a different computer or if someone else is working on the repository.

	Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
	stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
		Someone else could be working on repository as well so you would need to see those
		changes first.
